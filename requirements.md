# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Biometric Attendance System is an Android application designed to provide secure, location-based attendance tracking for educational institutions. The system combines biometric authentication (fingerprint and facial recognition) with geo-fencing technology to ensure students can only mark attendance when physically present at designated locations. The application operates offline-first, storing all data locally and syncing to remote servers when connectivity is available.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student, I want to mark my attendance using biometric authentication, so that my presence is securely verified without the need for manual check-ins or cards that can be lost or shared.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student attempts to mark attendance THEN the system SHALL prompt for biometric authentication using fingerprint or facial recognition
2. WHEN biometric authentication succeeds AND the student is within the geo-fence radius THEN the system SHALL record the attendance with timestamp
3. WHEN biometric authentication fails after 3 attempts THEN the system SHALL lock the attendance marking for 5 minutes
4. IF the device supports native facial recognition THEN the system SHALL use AndroidX BiometricPrompt API
5. IF the device does not support native facial recognition THEN the system SHALL use Google ML Kit Face Detection as fallback
6. WHEN using facial recognition THEN the system SHALL implement liveness detection to prevent spoofing attempts

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to create events with geo-fence boundaries, so that students can only mark attendance when they are physically present at the designated location.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin creates an event THEN the system SHALL allow setting a geo-fence with 50-meter radius around the event location
2. WHEN an admin defines an event THEN the system SHALL require event name, date, time, location coordinates, and sign-in/sign-out time windows
3. WHEN a student attempts attendance outside the geo-fence THEN the system SHALL prevent attendance marking and display location error
4. WHEN GPS is unavailable THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error message and prevent attendance marking
5. WHEN an admin modifies event details THEN the system SHALL update the geo-fence parameters immediately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student, I want the attendance system to work offline, so that I can mark attendance even when internet connectivity is poor or unavailable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the device is offline THEN the system SHALL store all attendance data locally using Room database
2. WHEN internet connectivity is restored THEN the system SHALL automatically sync local data to the remote server
3. WHEN biometric data is stored locally THEN the system SHALL encrypt it using AES-128 and Android Keystore
4. WHEN geo-fencing operates offline THEN the system SHALL rely solely on GPS coordinates without internet dependency
5. IF sync fails due to server issues THEN the system SHALL retry sync with exponential backoff strategy

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to manage student enrollment and biometric data, so that I can maintain accurate records and ensure system security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin enrolls a new student THEN the system SHALL capture student ID, name, course, and biometric templates
2. WHEN biometric enrollment occurs THEN the system SHALL store encrypted biometric references locally
3. WHEN a student's biometric data is updated THEN the system SHALL invalidate previous templates and require re-enrollment
4. WHEN an admin removes a student THEN the system SHALL securely delete all associated biometric data
5. WHEN biometric data is accessed THEN the system SHALL log all access attempts for audit purposes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want automatic penalty calculation for late or absent students, so that attendance policies are consistently enforced without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student marks attendance after the allowed time window THEN the system SHALL automatically mark them as late
2. WHEN a student fails to mark attendance within the event duration THEN the system SHALL automatically mark them as absent
3. WHEN calculating penalties THEN the system SHALL apply configurable SSC (Student Services Committee) rules
4. WHEN penalty thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL flag students for administrative review
5. WHEN penalty rules are updated THEN the system SHALL apply new rules to future attendance only

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an administrator, I want to generate and export attendance reports, so that I can analyze attendance patterns and share data with relevant stakeholders.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include student name, course, attendance status, timestamps, and penalties
2. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL support both Excel and CSV formats
3. WHEN sharing reports THEN the system SHALL allow direct sharing from the app via email or file sharing
4. WHEN filtering reports THEN the system SHALL support date ranges, courses, and attendance status filters
5. WHEN reports are generated THEN the system SHALL complete export within 30 seconds for up to 1000 records

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system user, I want role-based access control, so that students and administrators have appropriate permissions and cannot access unauthorized features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL authenticate using biometric methods and determine user role
2. WHEN a student accesses the app THEN the system SHALL only display attendance marking functionality
3. WHEN an admin accesses the app THEN the system SHALL display event management, enrollment, and reporting features
4. WHEN unauthorized access is attempted THEN the system SHALL log the attempt and deny access
5. WHEN user roles are modified THEN the system SHALL update permissions immediately without requiring app restart

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive security measures, so that biometric data and attendance records are protected from unauthorized access and tampering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN biometric data is stored THEN the system SHALL encrypt it using AES-128 encryption with Android Keystore
2. WHEN the app is backgrounded THEN the system SHALL automatically lock and require re-authentication
3. WHEN suspicious activity is detected THEN the system SHALL log security events and alert administrators
4. WHEN data is transmitted to servers THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS with certificate pinning
5. WHEN the device is rooted or compromised THEN the system SHALL detect the condition and restrict functionality
